# Introduction
Motivated by the goal of better understanding the data analyst job market, this project aims to identify the most lucrative and sought-after skills, simplifying the process for others to discover ideal job opportunities. Before proceeding with the analysis, I performed data cleaning to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful insights.
# Data Cleaning
1. **Remove duplicates**
2. **Standardize data**
3. **Null values or blank values**
4. **Remove columns and rows**

### *Let's create a new table (duplicate of our dataset).*

```sql
CREATE TABLE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
AS
TABLE 
    job_postings_fact;
```
### *Now, let's proceed to verify if we have duplicate with this query.*

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id, COUNT(*)
FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging
GROUP BY 
    job_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY 
    job_id;
```
*Looks like we don't have duplicates*

### *Let's standardize checking every columns.*

```sql

SELECT 
    job_title, TRIM(job_title)
FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging
WHERE 
    job_title <> TRIM(job_title)
ORDER by 
    job_title;
```
*Seem we have some rows to trim, let'so do it.*

```sql
UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    job_title = TRIM(job_title);
```
*Done, let's move on with the following columns.*

```sql
SELECT 
    job_location, TRIM(job_location)
FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging
WHERE 
    job_location <> TRIM(job_location);
```
*Here is all good, let's continue and eliminate 'via' from job_via column.*

```sql
UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    job_via = REPLACE(job_via, 'via','')
WHERE 
    job_via LIKE 'via%';
```
*Now let's group job type. For example, 'contractor%' in 'contractor' and then trim.*
```sql
UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    job_schedule_type = 
CASE
    WHEN job_schedule_type LIKE '%and%'THEN split_part(job_schedule_type,'and', 1)
    WHEN job_schedule_type LIKE '%,%' THEN split_part(job_schedule_type,',', 1)
    ELSE job_schedule_type
END;

UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    job_schedule_type = TRIM(job_schedule_type);

SELECT DISTINCT 
    job_schedule_type
FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging;
```
*Now we have grouped and modified the columns.*

```sql
UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    job_posted_date= job_posted_date::DATE;

ALTER TABLE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
ALTER COLUMN 
    job_posted_date TYPE DATE 
USING 
    job_posted_date::DATE;
```
*Above, we changed the date from timestamp to date as we don't really need the time.*

### *Now, let's eliminate null values or blank values.*

```sql
DELETE FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging
WHERE 
    salary_rate IS NULL;
```
*We have just deleted column with no salary as they give no usefull information.*

### * And lastly, let's verify if we have to remove any columns and/or rows.*

```sql
ALTER TABLE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
ADD COLUMN 
    salary_year_adjusted NUMERIC;
```
 *We insert a column to proportionate the rows with the hour salary with the rows with year salary.*

```sql
UPDATE 
    job_postings_fact_staging
SET 
    salary_year_adjusted = ROUND(
    CASE
        WHEN salary_year_avg IS NULL THEN salary_hour_avg*2080
        ELSE salary_year_avg
    END);
```
*Above, the calculation to round the column.*
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    job_postings_fact_staging
```
### *And the data cleaning is complete!!!*
